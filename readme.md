# Image to Text Conversion Project Documentation

## Introduction

The Image to Text Conversion project is a simple application that allows users to extract text content from images. It utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to analyze the image and convert the textual information present in the image into machine-readable text.

This project aims to provide a convenient and automated solution for extracting text from images, eliminating the need for manual transcription. It can be useful in various scenarios such as digitizing printed documents, extracting text from images for translation or analysis, and automating data entry processes.

## Scope

The scope of this project is to develop a web application that accepts an image file as input and returns the extracted text from that image. The project will involve the following components:

1.  Web interface: A user-friendly web interface where users can upload an image file and initiate the text extraction process.

2.  Image preprocessing: The uploaded image will undergo preprocessing steps to enhance the quality of the image and improve OCR accuracy. This may include operations like resizing, noise removal, and contrast adjustment.

3.  OCR processing: The preprocessed image will be passed through an OCR engine, specifically Tesseract OCR. Tesseract is a widely used open-source OCR engine that provides accurate text extraction capabilities.

4.  Text extraction: The OCR engine will analyze the image and extract the text content present in it. The extracted text will be returned as the output of the application.


## Technologies Used

The following technologies will be used in the Image to Text Conversion project:

1.  Python: The core logic of the application will be implemented using Python programming language. Python is a popular language for machine learning, image processing, and web development.

2.  Flask: Flask is a lightweight and extensible web framework for Python. It will be used to develop the web interface for uploading images and displaying the extracted text.

3.  Tesseract OCR: Tesseract OCR is an open-source OCR engine maintained by Google. It provides excellent text recognition capabilities and supports a wide range of languages. For more information on tesseract visit the  [tesseract documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/)

5.  PyTesseract: PyTesseract is a Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR. It allows easy integration of Tesseract OCR with Python applications and provides convenient methods for extracting text from images.


## Versions

The following versions of the technologies will be used in the project:

-   Python: 3.8.10
-   Flask: 2.0.1
-   Tesseract OCR: 5.0.0
-   PyTesseract: 0.3.8

## Setting up the Project

To set up the Image to Text Conversion project, follow these steps:

1.  Install Tesseract OCR and its development libraries by executing the following commands in the terminal:


    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:alex-p/tesseract-ocr5
    sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr
    sudo apt-get install -y libtesseract-dev
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 -y
    sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
    ```

1.  Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it:


    ```
    mkdir image-to-text-conversion
    cd image-to-text-conversion
    ```

2.  Set up a virtual environment for the project. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:



    `python3 -m virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate`

3.  Install the required Python packages by executing the following commands in the terminal:



    `pip install pytesseract
    pip install pdf2image
    pip install flask`



5.  Create the main Python script file, e.g. , `app.py`, and implement the Flask web application using the Flask and PyTesseract libraries. Refer to the Flask documentation and PyTesseract documentation for detailed implementation guidance.

6.  Create a directory named `templates`directory to store the HTML templates for the web interface:  `mkdir templates`





7.  Within the `templates` directory, create an HTML template file, e.g. , `index.html`, to define the structure and layout of the web page.

8.  Implement the necessary routes and logic in the Flask application to handle image uploads, preprocess the image, perform OCR processing using PyTesseract, and display the extracted text to the user.

9.  Run the Flask application by executing the following command in the terminal:

    `python app.py`

10.  Open a web browser and navigate to the specified URL where the Flask application is running. We should now be able to upload an image, process it, and view the extracted text on the web interface.

## Conclusion

The Image to Text Conversion project provides a convenient solution for extracting text content from images using OCR technology. With its user-friendly web interface and integration with Tesseract OCR, it enables users to easily convert images into machine-readable text. By following the setup instructions and customizing the application, we can create a powerful tool for automating text extraction from images.
